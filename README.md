-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality and security I should practice good programming naming and organization as well as conduct reviews and tests often.
Tests can include error handling and input sensitization but should be designed in such a way as to ensure thorough code coverage. manual review should 
also be used often to check for obvious mistakes or improper syntax.


-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to interpret user needs I must understand what the user needs from the system. This can be most effectively achieved by conducting interviews
and creating requirement documentation. The guidelines expressed in these documents will allow me to effectively create programs for the client's needs.


-How do I approach designing software?

Software should be an iterative process that focuses on creating basic building block and then working from there to create more complex systems.
This type of programming allows new constant testing as each portion of the program should be designed in a way that allows for segments to be tested
and integrated as they are worked on without needing to wait for large portions of the program. This allows testing to find problems early so that 
their impact can be mitigated.
