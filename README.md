# Grand_Strand_Systems_CS-320

### Description: 
This is a project that both demonstrates competency with Java as well as unit testing. The software is designed in such a way as to ensure that it not only meets outlined requirements, but demonstrates it’s completion and function. The software is designed be a personal contact manager that stores a list of contacts while also allowing a user to edit, delete or add new ones.

### Process:
This software required the creation of multiple components in Java that would handle both the contact objects and the services needed to make changes to the contact list. In order to effectively accomplish this the contact class was created first as all other components utilize it’s functionality. Testing was conducted and developed for each portion of the software in order to ensure functionality.

## Obstacles:
There were no serious obstacles in this assignment, however the assessment of user needs proved to be the most difficult aspect. This is due to the nebulous nature of what users expect the final product to be capable of. Developing the unit tests was fairly easy as it involved the process of automating the tests that I would have conducted manually.

## Course Questions:

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality and security I should practice good programming naming and organization as well as conduct reviews and tests often. Tests can include error handling and input sensitization but should be designed in such a way as to ensure thorough code coverage. manual review should 
also be used often to check for obvious mistakes or improper syntax.


### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to interpret user needs I must understand what the user intends to use the system for and all that will entail. This can be most effectively achieved by conducting interviews and creating requirement documentation. The guidelines expressed in these documents will allow me to effectively create programs for the client's needs.


### How do I approach designing software?

Software should be an iterative process that focuses on creating basic building blocks and then working from there to create more complex systems. This type of programming allows new and constant testing as each portion of the program should be designed in a way that allows for segments to be tested
and integrated as they are worked on without needing to wait for larger portions of the program. This allows testing to find problems early so that their impact can be mitigated.
